## 📌 Overview

This project focuses on the automatic recognition of traditional Bangladeshi folk musical instruments using deep learning techniques. A dataset of 3,000 images spanning 15 different instrument classes has been created and used to train various deep learning models for classification.

  

## 🎼 Dataset

The dataset consists of 3,000 images categorized into the following 15 folk instrument classes:

- 🎷 Bashi

- 🥁 Dhol

- 🎻 Veena

- 🎸 Tanpura

- 🎵 Ektara

- 🎶 Dotara

- And more...
